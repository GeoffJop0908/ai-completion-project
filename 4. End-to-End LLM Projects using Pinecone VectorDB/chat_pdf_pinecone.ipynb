Introduction\\nStock prediction focuses on estimating the future price movement in a stock, which is\\ngenerally perceived as a challenging task due to the non-stationarity and volatility of the\\nstock data. Dynamic stock market price variation and its chaotic behavior have increased\\nthe price prediction problem where the extreme non-linear, dynamic, complicated domain\\nknowledge inherent in the stock market has hiked the difﬁculty level for investors in\\nmaking prompt investment decisions (Esfahanipour and Aghamiri 2010; KKnill et al. 2012).\\nThere are two traditional theories to take into account when estimating the stock\\nprice, namely, efﬁcient market hypotheses (EMH) and random walk (RW) theory. EMH\\nstates that a stock price absorbs all known market knowledge at any time. Since market\\nparticipants optimally use all known information, price ﬂuctuations are unpredictable, as\\nnew information happens randomly (Fama 1970). Whereas according to the random walk\\ntheory, stock prices conduct a ‘random walk’, which means that all future prices do not\\nfollow any trends or patterns, and are a spontaneous deviation from previous prices, and\\nan investor cannot possibly forecast the market (Cheng and Deets 1971; Van Horne and\\nParker 1967). Another model that challenges EMH is Paul Samuelson’s martingale model\\n(Samuelson 1973), according to which, given all available information, current prices are\\nthe best predictors of an event’s outcome. The only signiﬁcant predictor of the ultimate\\noutcome, in particular, should be the most recent observed value (Richard and Vecer 2021).\\nThe validity of the EMH and RW theory have been controversial. Therefore, with\\nthe emergence of computational and smart ﬁnance, and behavioral ﬁnance, economists\\nhave tried to establish another theory referred to as the inefﬁcient market hypothesis\\n(IMH), which states that ﬁnancial markets are not always considered efﬁcient markets.\\nMarket inefﬁciencies exist due to market psychology, transaction costs, information asym-\\nmetries, and human emotions (Asadi et al. 2012). The majority of studies have used AI\\ntechniques to support those arguments, and the fact that certain players can consistently\\nJ.

As a viable alternative to the EMH, the fractal market hypoth-\\nesis (FMH) has also been established (Dar et al. 2017) by Peters (1994). According to the\\nFMH, markets are stabilized by matching the demand and supply of investors’ investment\\nhorizons, whereas the EMH supposes that markets are in equilibrium (Dar et al. 2017;\\nKarp and Van Vuuren 2019).\\nFMH examines the market’s daily randomness and the turbulence experienced during\\ncrashes and crises, and provides a compelling explanation for investor behavior over the\\ncourse of a market cycle, including booms and busts (Moradi et al. 2021). Interestingly,\\nit also considers the non-linear relationships in time series problems, hence making it a\\nsuitable theory for stock prediction and other time series (Aslam et al. 2021; Kakinaka and\\nUmeno 2021; Naeem et al. 2021; Tilfani et al. 2020), or ﬁnancial market related problems\\n(Anderson and Noss 2013; Kumar et al. 2017; Singh et al. 2013). Nowadays, the value\\nand beneﬁts of forecasting in decision- and policy-making are unquestionably recognized\\nacross multiple dimensions. Naturally, the techniques that encounter the least amount\\nof forecasting errors will survive and function properly (Moradi et al. 2021). Henceforth,\\nmany individuals, including academics, investment professionals, and average investors\\nor traders, are actively searching for this superior system that will deliver high returns.\\nStock price prediction based on time series of relevant variables and behavioral pat-\\nterns (Khan et al. 2020a) helps determine prediction efﬁciency(Zahedi and Rounaghi 2015).\\nAccurate modelling requires considering external phenomena that include recession or ex-\\npansion periods and high- or low-volatility periods driven by cyclical and other short-term\\nﬂuctuations in aggregate demand (Atsalakis and Valavanis 2009b). One of the essential\\nrequirements for anyone related to economic environments is to correctly predict market\\nprice changes and make correct decisions based on those predictions. Stock-market pre-\\ndictions have been a prevalent research topic for many years. The ﬁnancial beneﬁt may\\nbe considered the most critical problem of stock-market prediction. When a system can\\nreliably select winners and losers in the competitive market environment, it will generate\\nmore income for the system owner.\\nThis problem calls for developing intelligent systems for fetching real-time pricing\\ninformation, which can enhance the proﬁt-maximization for investors (Esfahanipour and\\nAghamiri 2010). Several intelligent systems or AI techniques have been developed in\\nrecent years for decision support, modelling expertise, and complicated automation tasks,\\nincluding artiﬁcial networks, genetic algorithms, support vector machines, machine learn-\\ning, probabilistic belief networks, and fuzzy logic (Chen et al. 2005; Sharma et al. 2020).\\nAmong all these techniques, artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are widely popular across\\nthe ﬁelds mainly due to their ability to analyze complex non-linear relationships between\\ninput and output variables directly by learning the training data (Baba and Suto 2000). The\\ncharacteristic of ANNs in providing models for a large class of real systems has attracted\\nthe attention of researchers seeking to apply ANNs to various decision support systems.\\nNevertheless, despite growing concerns for ANNs utilization, only limited success has\\nbeen achieved so far mainly due to the random behavior and complexity of the stock\\nmarket (Baba and Suto 2000).\\nSeveral studies have examined stock price forecasting using artiﬁcial intelligence.\\nFor e.g., Atsalakis and Valavanis (2009b) reviewed around 100 studies focusing on neural\\nand neuro-fuzzy techniques applied to forecast stock markets; Bahrammirzaee (2010)\\nconducted a comparative research review of three popular artiﬁcial intelligence techniques,\\ni.e., expert systems, artiﬁcial neural networks, and hybrid intelligent systems, applied\\nin ﬁnance; Gandhmal and Kumar (2019) systematically analyzed and reviewed stock\\nmarket prediction techniques; Strader et al. (2020) also systematically reviewed relevant\\npublications from the past twenty years, and classiﬁed them based on similar methods and\\ncontexts; and Obthong et al. (2020) surveyed machine learning algorithms and techniques\\nfor stock price prediction. While these contributions illuminated broad aspects of stock'),\n",

Successful AI-based\\nmodels can assist stock traders, brokers, and investors in achieving massive gains that\\npreviously appeared impossible. When ﬁnancial markets become more predictable, more\\ninvestors will invest with conﬁdence, allowing businesses to raise additional funds (via\\nstock markets) to repay debt, launch new goods, and expand operations. As a result,\\nconsumer and corporate conﬁdence will increase, which will beneﬁt the broader economy\\n(Müller 2019). Depositories will also see an increase in business as a result of the enlarged\\ninvestor base. Increased investment in ﬁnancial markets results in increased tax collections,\\nwhich beneﬁts the government (Neuhierl and Weber 2017). Increased money ﬂow from\\ninvestors or traders will also help ﬁnancial institutions such as banks, mutual fund orga-\\nnizations, insurance businesses, and investment corporations (Neuhierl and Weber 2017;\\nŠkrinjari´ c and Orlovi´ c 2020). Additionally, just 0.128 percent of the world’s population\\ntrades or invests in the stock market—the remainder either lack access to the internet, or\\nlack understanding of ﬁnancial trading (Asktraders 2020). The majority of active traders\\nand investors are afraid of trading and investing in ﬁnancial markets because they lack the\\nability to appropriately forecast stock values due to market volatility (Smales 2017). As a\\nresult, they need to adopt an excellent forecasting model to instil investor trust and make\\nmassive proﬁts (Hao and Gao 2020). We claim, in this review, that successful technology,\\nsupported by new AI-based models, can assist stock traders, brokers, and investors in\\nattaining a competitive edge, which previously seemed unattainable.\\nOur study contributes by providing a coherent presentation and classiﬁcation of\\nartiﬁcial intelligence methods applied to various ﬁnancial markets, which can be used for\\nfurther analysis and comparison, as well as comparative studies. Moreover, our study also\\nprovides detailed future avenues on ‘feature selection algorithms’, ‘prediction range’ (long-\\nterm, short-term, and very short-term (minute-wise/hour-wise)), ‘stock markets covered’,\\n‘data pre-processing techniques’, ‘prediction forms’ (one-step-ahead and multiple-steps-\\nahead), and ‘performance measures’.\\nAdditionally, the literature on the usage of artiﬁcial intelligence and soft comput-\\ning techniques for stock market prediction is yet to develop an accurate predictive model\\n(Zhou et al. 2019). One, the selection of input data is not rigorous in the majority of the stud-\\nies leading to ﬂawed model simulations and series estimations (Bildirici and Ersin 2009;\\nDhenuvakonda et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2021). Two, the extant literature is, at best, partially\\nsuccessful in optimizing the parameter selections and model architectures (Tealab 2018).\\nThree, the pre-processing of input data has not been carried out with precision in the\\nextant literature so far (Atsalakis and Valavanis 2009b). To consolidate the extant litera-\\nture and direct it towards developing a robust AI-based stock prediction model, we carry\\nout this systematic literature review of papers listed on the Web of Science (WoS) and\\nScopus databases.\\nWe begin by presenting an organizing framework classifying the extant literature\\ninto two major categories: study characteristics and model characteristics, where ‘study\\ncharacteristics’ is further classiﬁed into the stock market covered, input data, and nature of\\nthe study; and ‘model parameter’ is grouped as data pre-processing, artiﬁcial intelligence\\ntechnique, training algorithm, and performance measure (Figure 1). Our organizing\\nframework is paralleled with a cohesive presentation of AI techniques employed on stock\\nmarket predictions that can be used as a reference for future analysis and evaluation.\\nThe rest of the paper is structured in the following manner. The second section\\nrepresents the methodology of the paper outlining the keywords searched, acceptance\\ncriteria applied, and categorization framework. The third section outlays the trends and\\ngeneral description of the existing literature. The fourth section provides the results of this\\npaper, as well as the thematic discussion that discusses the categories and subcategories.'),\n",

(2019) and Tranﬁeld et al.\\n(2003), and involves a rigorous review protocol enabling a high level of transparency and\\nreplicability. The search was conducted in May 2021 on the WoS and Scopus database(s)\\nafter identifying keywords (search terms) related to the artiﬁcial intelligence techniques\\nin the title. The keywords used are ‘neur*’, ‘artiﬁcial*’, ‘AI’, ‘machine learning’, ‘deep\\nlearning’, ‘fuzzy’, ‘soft computing’, ‘forecast*’, ‘predict*’, ‘estimate*’, ‘stock market’, ‘stock\\nreturn’, ‘stock price’, ‘share return’, ‘share market’, ‘share price’, ‘index return’, ‘index price’,\\nalong with the required Boolean operators (‘AND’, ‘OR’, ‘NOT’, ‘NEAR’, ‘W/n’, etc.). Both\\nthe WoS and Scopus databases are referred to the search for relevant articles due to their\\nmultidisciplinary nature, and easier access to literature belonging to economics, ﬁnance,\\nmanagement, psychology, technology, etc., enabling them to attain the most signiﬁcant\\nand latest studies. Moreover, both the databases have good coverage, which goes back\\nto 1990, compared to other databases (Jain et al. 2019). We set the limit for the search to\\narticles published between 1989 and 2021 (Rosado-Serrano et al. 2018). The papers are\\nonly extracted and evaluated if they are indexed by WoS and Scopus (for high credibility),'),\n",

Most Contributing Countries\\nTable 2 presents the top ten most contributing or productive countries, along with\\ntheir international collaboration and citation analysis in the area of stock market prediction\\nusing AI. The documents retrieved were written by authors from 27 different countries.\\nChina was the most proliﬁc publisher, followed by India, the USA, and Japan. Nonetheless,\\nChina (total citations = 1173) is unquestionably the leader in terms of total citations, as\\nwell as productivity (number of published articles = 42 (28.37 percent)). Five countries\\n(i.e., Japan, Iran, Korea, Brazil, Australia in Table 2) hosted authors who published in\\nthe stock prediction using AI area (ergo, isolated countries in a collaboration aspect). In\\ncomparison, the remainder had at least one study that was published in multiple countries,\\nwhere China (7) has the largest multi-country publications. The reason for this can be\\nattributed to the growing emphasis on research and development, as well as increasing\\nfunding opportunities, in the country (Schoenmakers et al. 2021).\\nTable 2.

Thematic Discussion\\n4.1. Study Characteristics\\nThis section comprehends the extant literature concerning the stock markets covered,\\nthe type of input variables used, and the usage of comparative analysis.\\n4.1.1. Stock Markets Covered\\nThe extant literature explores different world indices and stock markets to extract the in-\\nput data directly or indirectly, to train and test their model(Atsalakis and Valavanis 2009b),\\nand subsequently, predict the future prices. Some studies focus on predicting the stock\\nindices at particular points in time, to offer conclusions regarding the related risks, thereby\\nraising questions on the reliability of market robustness for highly successful investments.\\nSuch cases can signiﬁcantly contribute towards vital information about accurate forecasting\\nof models, stock markets, and stock returns (Atsalakis 2014).\\nThis category is designed according to the world continents coded as sub-categories\\n(Europe, Asia, Oceania, America, and Africa) (as given in Table A1). The surveyed stock\\nindices from developed markets include Standard and Poor’s 500 (S & P 500), the Dow Jones\\nIndustrial Average (DJIA), New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and National Association\\nof Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) from: the USA (Chenoweth and\\nObradovi´ c 1996; Donaldson and Kamstra 1999); the Tokyo Stock Exchange Index (TOPIX)\\nand NIKKEI in Japan (Bekiros 2007; Dai et al. 2012); the Financial Times Stock Exchange\\n100 Share (FTSE) in London (Kanas 2001; Kanas and Yannopoulos 2001; Vella and Ng 2014);\\nthe main German Stock Exchange index, DAX (Hafezi et al. 2015; Rast 1999; Siekmann et al.\\n2001; Vella and Ng 2014); the Toronto stock exchange (TSX) indices in Canada (Olson and\\nMossman 2003); the Australian stock exchange index (ASX) in Australia (Pan et al. 2005;\\nVanstone et al. 2005); and the New Zealand stock index (NZX-50) in New Zealand (Fong\\net al. 2005). Among all the developed stock indices, S & P 500 has the highest percentage of\\npreference, used in 25% of studies as an input (Kim and Lee 2004).\\nEven though most of the studies have analyzed stocks from developed countries,\\nequity stock markets from emerging nations are also considered in some works. From Asia,\\nthese include: the Korean stock market (Baek and Kim 2018; Oh and Kim 2002); the Chinese\\nstock market (Baek and Kim 2018; Cao et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2018; Oh and Kim 2002);'),\n",

From Latin America, this includes\\nthe Brazilian stock market (De Oliveira et al. 2013; De Souza et al. 2012). From Europe,\\nthis includes: the Greece stock market (Atsalakis et al. 2011; Koulouriotis et al. 2005); the\\nTurkish stock market (Bildirici and Ersin 2009; Göçken et al. 2016); the Slovakian stock\\nmarket (Marˇ cek 2004); the Czech Republic stock market (Baruník 2008); the Hungarian\\nstock market (Baruník 2008); and the Polish stock market (Baruník 2008). From Africa, this\\nincludes the Tunisian stock market (Slim 2010).\\nA few studies focus on using independent stocks or a portfolio of stocks instead of a\\nparticular stock exchange market index. For example, Pantazopoulos et al. (1998) use IBM\\nstock price as input, Steiner and Wittkemper (1997) selected 16 stocks from DAX as input,\\nAtsalakis and Valavanis (2006b, 2009a) have incorporated ﬁve stocks from the Athens Stock\\nExchange and the NYSE as input, and the research by Wah and Qian (2006) applied to\\n10 stocks from the NYSE.\\n4.1.2. Input Variables\\nThe input variable selection is one of the crucial steps in AI model development,\\nas their poor selection negatively impacts the model’s performance during training and\\ntesting phases (Hsieh et al. 2011). The extant literature projects different points of view\\nwhen selecting (subjectively) appropriate variables for forecasting stock return behavior.\\nMost of the studies use random input variables without explaining their selection criteria,\\nhowever, using a proper selection criterion may be beneﬁcial for obtaining superior results\\n(Atsalakis 2014). We classify the extant literature based on the input variables (including\\ntechnical indicators, economic variables, stock market data, and ﬁnancial performance\\ndata and textual data) used in the models of reviewed articles (as given in Table A2). On\\naverage, the literature uses two to ten input variables for their model. However, Olson\\nand Mossman (2003), Zorin and Borisov (2007), Enke and Thawornwong (2005), Lendasse\\net al. (2000), Zahedi and Rounaghi (2015), and De Oliveira et al. (2013) have used 61,\\n59, 31, 25, 20, and 18 input variables, respectively. The extant literature applies speciﬁc\\ntechniques to choose the most important input variables for the forecasting process among\\nmany selection criteria, based on the effect of each input on the result obtained (Atsalakis\\nand Valavanis 2009b). A few studies cover a vast horizon of observations over the years, as\\nmentioned by Kosaka et al. (1991), who use 300 stock prices as input.\\nSome studies provide no explanation for selecting input variables, and directly select\\nexplanatory variables from the previous literature that explain the effectiveness of using\\nsuch variables in the least-squares method, stepwise regression, or neural networks (Qiu\\net al. 2016). The majority of the literature uses daily data, with only a few cases of missing\\nvalues, as there is no assurance of obtaining better results if the period is kept longer. For\\nexample, Ortega and Khashanah (2014) use 2600 observations, Xi et al. (2014) use only\\n60 observations, and Adebiyi et al. (2014) use ten years of daily data. The technical indicator\\nis a valuable tool for stock analysts and fund managers to analyze the real market situation,\\nand therefore, using them can be more informative than using fair prices. Approximately\\n21 of the surveyed studies use technical indicators as input variables, which are sometimes\\ncombined with daily or previous closing prices, as mentioned by Kim and Han (2000),\\nArmano et al. (2005), and Jaruszewicz and Ma ´ ndziuk (2004). Most of the authors may be\\nbiased toward fundamental and technical analysis, as they are complements rather than\\nsubstitutes, thereby combining the related variables (Wu and Duan 2017).\\nForecasting stock return or a stock index involves an assumption that publicly avail-\\nable information in the past has the power to predict the future returns or indices, and\\nthe sample of such information includes economic variables. It includes interest rates,\\nexchange rates, bond prices, gold prices, crude oil prices, industry-speciﬁc information,'),\n",

Some studies use daily closing prices of well-established markets\\nlike the S & P 500 and DJIA combined with the economic variables. For example, Wu et al.\\n(2001) use previous S & P 500 values and six economic indices as input variables, whereas\\nMaknickiene et al. (2018) input daily closing prices of American stock market indexes and\\neconomic variables into their model. Thawornwong and Enke (2004) and Qiu et al. (2016)\\nhave combined economic variables with ﬁnancial variables as input.\\nStock market data are one of the most commonly used input variables, covering\\n50% of surveyed articles. The stock market data includes daily opening/closing price\\n(Chen et al. 2018; Gao and Chai 2018; Lei 2018), the daily minimum/maximum price\\n(Chen et al. 2018; Gao and Chai 2018; Kim and Kim 2019; Lei 2018), transaction volume\\n(Kim and Kim 2019; Lei 2018), dividend yield (Kanas 2001; Kanas and Yannopoulos 2001),\\nlagged returns or prices (including stock or index returns, and the value of stocks or indices)\\n(Baruník 2008; Mahmud and Meesad 2016), and the closing price of previous days (up\\nto a week or month) (Gholamreza et al. 2010; Mahmud and Meesad 2016). The extant\\nliterature has combined stock market data with technical variables, economic variables, or\\nﬁnancial indicators depending upon the input selection criteria employed. The ﬁnancial\\nperformance data are related to the ﬁnancial indicators of the company, such as the price-\\nearnings ratio (Kim et al. 1998), market capitalization (Cao et al. 2005; Chaturvedi and\\nChandra 2004), accounting ratios (Olson and Mossman 2003; Zahedi and Rounaghi 2015),\\nprice-to-book value (Rihani and Garg 2006), common shares outstanding (Cao et al. 2011),\\nthe value of beta (market risk) (Cao et al. 2005; Chaturvedi and Chandra 2004), etc.\\nDue to the ﬁnancial markets’ vulnerability to a variety of activities, including corporate\\ntakeovers, new product launches, and global pandemics, a few researchers have used\\ntextual data as feedback to AI models (Khan et al. 2020a). The textual data includes Google\\ntrends data (Hu et al. 2018), newspaper articles (Matsubara et al. 2018), microblogs (Khan\\net al. 2020a), posts or content on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook\\n(Khan et al. 2020a), etc.\\nSuch textual data comes predominantly from three sources, namely, public corporate\\ndisclosures/ﬁlings, media articles, and internet messages (Fernández-López et al. 2018).\\nFurthermore, researchers have also integrated sentiment analysis in prediction models to\\nobtain higher prediction accuracy, which is gaining widespread attention (Maknickiene\\net al. 2018). The textual data contains a public and political sentiment that has a massive\\npotential of strongly impacting stock returns and trading volumes. In fact, the extant\\nliterature using textual information posits that textual sentiment has coexistent or short-\\nterm effects on stock prices, abnormal returns, returns, and trading volumes (Kearney and\\nLiu 2014; Tetlock 2007; Tetlock et al. 2008).\\nMany studies have included textual data along with stock market data to obtain\\nbetter prediction accuracy. For instance, Khan et al. (2020a) analyzed the social media\\nand ﬁnancial news data for predicting the stock market data for ten subsequent days,\\nand their results reported a higher prediction accuracy of 80.53% and 75.16% after using\\ntextual data. Similarly, Khan et al. (2020b) used the sentiment and situation feature in their\\nmachine learning model, and their ﬁndings unveil that the sentiment feature enhances the\\nprediction accuracy by 0–3%, whereas the political situation feature enhances the prediction\\naccuracy by about 20%. Hao et al. (2021) analyzed ﬁnancial news and stock price data of\\nTaiwan-based companies to predict the stock price trends using fuzzy SVMs and traditional\\nSVMs, where hybrid fuzzy SVMs reported superior prediction accuracy. Mehta et al.\\n(2021) utilized ﬁnancial news as input data into their machine learning and deep learning\\nmodels, and their results reported more than 80% accuracy, validating the success of the\\nproposed methodology. Additionally, researchers have incorporated sentiment analysis\\ninto prediction models to improve prediction accuracy, a topic that has gained widespread\\ninterest (Maknickiene et al. 2018).'),\n",

Nature of Study\\nThis section represents the comparison made by the authors of their benchmark\\nmodels against other models to demonstrate the superior performance of the benchmark\\nmodels. Over 88 percent of reviewed articles have studied the comparison in order to check\\nthe accuracy of their benchmark models, which are neural networks or hybrid-neuro for\\nthis study, including fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM), support vector machines (SVM), feed-\\nforward neural networks (FFNN), recurrent networks, probabilistic neural networks (PNN),\\nradial basis function network (RBFN), and others concerning the conventional techniques,\\nsuch as GARCH family models, autoregressive (AR), autoregressive integrated moving\\naverage (ARIMA), autoregressive moving average (ARMA), RW (random walk), B and\\nH strategy, stochastic volatility models, linear, and non-linear models. The comparison is\\nmade interchangeably with any of the conventional and non-conventional techniques, and\\nthe performance is measured with the help of different performance metrics, as depicted in\\nthe performance measure section. For example: Kimoto et al. (1990), Refenes et al. (1993),\\nQi (1999), and Sagir and Sathasivan (2017) have compared their ANN models with LR\\nand MLR techniques; Harvey et al. (2000), Motiwalla and Wahab (2000), Thawornwong\\nand Enke (2004) have made a comparison of the ANN model with LR, MLR, and the ‘buy\\nand hold’ strategy; Zorin and Borisov (2007) and Saﬁ and White (2017) have compared the\\nANN model with ARIMA; and Wu and Duan (2017) have analyzed both the Elman neural\\nnetwork- and BP neural network-based stock prediction models for comparison.\\nFurthermore, we observed that hybrid AI models are superior in terms of prediction\\naccuracy, accounting for more than 90% (Atsalakis and Valavanis 2009a; Esfahanipour and\\nAghamiri 2010), in contrast with individual AI models that report prediction accuracy\\nbetween 50–70% (Di Persio and Honchar 2016; Malagrino et al. 2018; Pang et al. 2020). For\\ninstance, Rather et al. (2015) compared the performance of RNN and a hybrid prediction\\nmodel (HPM) in forecasting stock returns of ﬁve companies listed on the NSE, and their\\nresults showed an outstanding prediction performance of the HPM in comparison to RNN.\\nSimilarly, Hao and Gao (2020) also aimed to predict stock market index trends using a\\nhybrid-neural network that uses multiple time scale feature learning, and compared the\\nresults with the benchmark AI models, such as simple ANN, SVM, LSTM, CNN, and the\\nmultiple pipeline model. Their ﬁndings showed an accuracy of 74.55%, which was the\\nmaximum achieved after running all the models.\\nMoreover, in surveyed articles, AI models showcase better performance when com-\\npared with traditional models (Baruník 2008; Bildirici and Ersin 2009). For example, Khansa\\nand Liginlal (2011) compared vector autoregression and time-delayed neural networks\\nfor predicting stock market returns, and the prediction accuracy of time-delayed neural\\nnetworks was 22% greater when compared with the vector autoregression. Likewise, Sagir\\nand Sathasivan (2017) attempted to predict the future index of the Malaysia Stock Exchange\\nMarket using the ANN model and multiple linear regressions (MLR), and traditional\\nforecasting techniques, and their ﬁndings conﬁrm the higher prediction accuracy for the\\nANN model when compared to the traditional MLR technique.\\n4.2. Model Characteristics\\nThis section details the speciﬁcations of forecasting methodology imbibed by authors\\nin their studies, and the categories classiﬁed are: data pre-processing; artiﬁcial intelligence\\ntechnique; training algorithm; and performance measure. Data pre-processing is usually\\ndone to prepare the data before using it as an input in the AI model for stock prediction.\\nThe category ‘artiﬁcial intelligence technique’ gives us the brief of the type of neural\\nnetwork, the transfer function, and the number of layers (input, hidden, and output)\\nused in AI models by authors. The training phase in the model computation requires a\\ntraining algorithm that helps in minimizing the performance error of the model, therefore,\\nit is assigned as a separate category, and the last classiﬁcation ‘performance measure’\\noutlays the various performance measures or their combinations used for the comparison\\nof different model performances.'),\n",

Risk Financial Manag. 2021, 14, 526 13 of 34\\n4.2.1. Data Pre-Processing\\nTheoretically, there is no requirement in reducing the input variable dimension for the\\nneural network-based nonlinear modelling technique, as it can easily reach the regional\\nminimum convergence level. However, with the development of the information age and\\nincreasing data complexity, data pre-processing has become indispensable for most of the\\nauthors in their study (Qiu et al. 2016). The stock market returns prediction via neural\\nnetworks has some limitations due to a tremendous amount of noise, non-stationarity, and\\ncomplex dimensionality, which can be overcome if data pre-processing is performed before\\nthe stock returns prediction using neural networks that involve a transformation of the raw,\\nreal-world data to a set of new vectors (Qiu et al. 2016). The aim of data pre-processing\\nis to minimize the estimated error between the data before and after the transformation,\\nthereby reducing the risk of over-ﬁtting in the training phase (Hsieh et al. 2011). The\\nsurveyed articles display whether the data is pre-processed in their study or not, hence,\\nthe sub-themes are designed accordingly (as given in Table A3).\\nData is pre-processed in 55% of the surveyed articles, and the pre-processing tech-\\nniques used are data normalization, principal component analysis (PCA) (Abraham et al.\\n2001), and Z score (Leigh et al. 2002). The data normalization technique is further divided\\ninto logarithmic data pre-processing (Chun and Park 2005; Constantinou et al. 2006; Dai\\net al. 2012) and data scaling between the ranges of 0 to 1 (Bisoi and Dash 2014; Dash and\\nDash 2016; Mahmud and Meesad 2016; Nayak et al. 2016; Wu and Duan 2017), −1 to 1\\n(Ghasemiyeh et al. 2017; Hu et al. 2018; Inthachot et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2012; Zahedi and\\nRounaghi 2015), and −0.5 to 0.5 (Lei 2018). The data are normalized in order to synchronize\\nthe input data with the activation function used in the neural networks, which is a bounded\\nfunction and is not capable of exceeding its upper bound when the stock data easily over-\\nshoots, thereby causing inconsistencies in training, testing, and validation phases (Hui\\net al. 2000). The PCA involves feature extraction that follows a quantitative approach for\\ntransforming a more signiﬁcant number of (potentially) correlated factors (or variables) into\\na (fewer) number of uncorrelated factors called principal components (Abraham et al. 2001).\\nThe pre-processed data is fed into the neural networks for stock returns prediction, where\\nthe neural network ‘learns’ and trains itself after adjusting the interconnection weights\\nbetween its layers (Abraham et al. 2001). It is interesting to highlight that not all articles\\nprovide details about data pre-processing techniques used or whether any pre-processing\\noccurs, however, all the articles referring to data pre-processing ﬁnd it to be necessary\\nbefore the actual data analysis process starts (Atsalakis and Valavanis 2009b).\\n4.2.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence Technique\\nArtiﬁcial intelligence refers to replicating human behavior by a machine with a set\\nof highly complex input data required for learning and training, to produce an expected\\noutput (Wu and Duan 2017). The AI techniques such as ANNs, fuzzy logic, and genetic\\nalgorithms (GAs) are popular research subjects used by most authors in their study, as they\\ncan deal with complex problems that classical methods cannot solve. This study focuses on\\nneural- and hybrid-neuro networks derived and applied to forecast stock markets.\\nAn ANN consists of a system of interconnected ‘neurons’ that compute ﬁgures from\\ninput data so that input neurons feed the values to the hidden layer neurons, and the\\nhidden layer provides them for the output layer (Zahedi and Rounaghi 2015). They are\\nnon-linear networks with the advantages of self-organizing, data-driven, self-learning\\ncapability, self-adaptive, and an associated memory, similar to the human brain, used to\\nconduct, classify, predict, and recognize patterns (Hu et al. 2018). They also can learn\\nand obtain hidden functional relationships, hence, they have been excessively used in the\\nﬁnancial ﬁelds, such as stock prices, returns, proﬁts forecasting, exchange rate, and risk\\nanalysis and prediction (Wang and Wang 2015). Different types of neural networks include\\nFFNNs (Andreou et al. 2000; Atiya et al. 1997), BPNN 1s (Quah 1999; Witkowska 1995),\\nMLP-ANNs (Kanas 2001; Kanas and Yannopoulos 2001), and RNNs (Gao and Chai 2018;\\nHsieh et al. 2011) (as presented in Table A4). Feed-forward neural networks are one'),\n",

The essential\\ncharacteristic of FFNNs is that they are the simplest, and only establish connections with\\nneurons in a forward manner, and they do not communicate with neurons on the same or\\nthe previous layer (Zavadskaya 2017). Additionally, they may or may not have the hidden\\nlayers, but compulsorily have both the input and output layers. Due to such simplicity,\\nthey cannot be used for deep learning problems, owing to the absence of backpropagation\\nand dense layers (Chen and Abraham 2006).\\nBPNNs apply back-propagation of the error gradient to ﬁne-tune the weights of the\\nneural network obtained in the previous epoch (i.e., iteration). Such tuning aids in reduc-\\ning the error rates, and makes the model highly reliable by increasing its generalization\\n(Rumelhart et al. 1986). Lately, many studies have started using convolutional neural net-\\nworks (CNNs), which are a type of feed-forward networks only, but have grid-like topology,\\nunlike other neural networks. They apply a specialized kind of linear operation, and use\\nconvolution, apart from general matrix multiplication, in at least one of their layers. Studies\\nthat have employed CNN’s include Cao and Wang (2019), Chung and Shin (2020), Liu et al.\\n(2020), and Wu et al. (2021).\\nThe hybrids include: reasoning neural networks (Tsaih et al. 1998); long short term\\nmemory RNNs (LSTM-RNNs) (Qiu et al. 2020; Selvin et al. 2017; Zhuge et al. 2017);\\ntemporal difference learning (TD-Learning) neural networks (Baba and Suto 2000); genetic\\nalgorithm-based neural networks (Inthachot et al. 2016; Matilla-García and Argüello 2005);\\nElman neural networks (Halliday 2004); recurrent ﬁnite impulse-response neural networks\\n(RFIR-ANN) (Wah and Qian 2006); adaptive time-delay neural networks (ATNNs) and\\nthe time delay neural networks (TDNNs) (Kim and Shin 2007); neural network-GARCH\\nmodels (Bildirici and Ersin 2009; Guresen et al. 2011); autoregressive moving reference\\nneural networks (Rather et al. 2015); and principal component analysis-based neural\\nnetworks The multi-layer perceptron neural networks use a feed-forward algorithm and\\nsupervised learning for complex non-linear functions with a signiﬁcant accuracy rate\\n(Zavadskaya 2017). MLP-ANNs are usually trained with static backpropagation, and are\\nprimarily used for deep learning problems, as they have dense, fully connected layers, but\\nthey tend to become slower with the number of hidden layers (Mo and Wang 2013). Few\\nstudies use MLP-ANNs with other neural networks as well, for example, Ghasemiyeh\\net al. (2017) have employed MLP combined with the dynamic artiﬁcial neural network\\n(DAN2) in their study, and Hui et al. (2000) have used the hybrid time lagged network\\n(HTLN), which integrates the supervised multilayer perceptron using a temporal back-\\npropagation algorithm with the unsupervised learning of the Kohonen network for stock\\nreturns prediction. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is another version of ANN, which\\nuses a feedback mechanism, and is designed to learn sequential or time-varying patterns\\n(Gao and Chai 2018). They have dynamic cycled connectivity between their nodes for\\ncommunicating to the neurons in all the layers of the networks, and store the information\\n(Zavadskaya 2017).\\nLately, researchers have been actively using deep learning networks that exploit mul-\\ntiple layers of non-linear information processing with either supervised or unsupervised\\nfeature extraction and transformation, and for classiﬁcation and pattern analysis (Ghai\\net al. 2021). The reasons behind their increased popularity include their drastically high\\nchip processing abilities, and the increased size and complexity of data used for training\\n(Deng and Yu 2013). Examples of deep learning neural networks are CNNs, LSTMs, RNNs,\\nRBFNs, MLPs, etc.\\nIn fact, the traditional neural networks (such as simple ANN and BPNN) have a shal-\\nlow neural network structure with an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer (fewer\\nlayers), which lack effective learning and efﬁcient data feature representation, thus affect-\\ning prediction accuracy. Therefore, researchers have started using deep learning neural\\nnetworks, as they have a superior computational capacity, and report higher prediction\\naccuracy (Cao and Wang 2019).'),\n",

Risk Financial Manag. 2021, 14, 526 15 of 34\\nThe number of layers in the neural network models (input, hidden, and output\\nlayers) varies in the reviewed articles, however, the majority study three-layer architecture.\\nRepresentative studies include Constantinou et al. (2006), Inthachot et al. (2016), and Kim\\nand Kim (2019), who have used three layers in their model, whereas Chen et al. (2018)\\nand Rather et al. (2015) have used four layers in their model. The fewer the hidden units\\nin the hidden layer, the more generalizable the ANN is. It is necessary not to over-ﬁt\\nthe ANN with a large number of hidden units before the data can be memorized. This\\nissue is because the hidden units are like a storage system in character. It learns about the\\nnoise present in the training set, along with the key structures, which are not needed to\\nbe generalized (Quah 1999). A transfer (activation) function exists between every layer,\\nwhich determines the strength that enables transmission of the summed signal to the next\\nconnected layer (Matilla-Garc ía and Argüello 2005). The transfer (activation) function\\nhelps in preventing the outputs from reaching huge values that can paralyze the ANN\\nstructure (Duch and Jankowski 1999). The transfer functions employed between different\\nlayers by the reviewed articles are log (Cao et al. 2011), sigmoid (Ghasemiyeh et al. 2017),\\nhyperbolic tangent (Ruxanda and Badea 2014), tangent (Inthachot et al. 2016), and pure\\nlinear functions (Ghasemiyeh et al. 2017; Göçken et al. 2016; Guo et al. 2015).\\nThe fuzzy and hybrids have an advantage over expert systems, as they can easily\\nextract rules without explicitly formalizing them, which is an important factor in a chaotic\\nand partially understood stock market environment, and the representative studies using\\nthe fuzzy models are Bekiros (2007), Mahmud and Meesad (2016), Rajab and Sharma(2019),\\nand Sugumar et al. (2014). Different membership functions are used for fuzziﬁcation and\\ndefuzziﬁcation, which are: generalized bell (Atsalakis and Valavanis 2006a; Mahmud and\\nMeesad 2016; Vella and Ng 2014); Gaussian (Bisoi and Dash 2014; Dash and Dash 2016;\\nRajab and Sharma 2019); logistic; sigmoid (Enke and Mehdiyev 2013; Laboissiere et al. 2015;\\nRather et al. 2015); trapezoid (Atsalakis et al. 2011; Dong and Zhou 2002); and triangular\\n(Gradojevic et al. 2002; Hadavandi et al. 2010) membership functions.\\nThe extant literature also talks about type-1 and type-2 fuzzy neural network systems\\n(Huarng and Yu 2005), where type-1 fuzzy neural networks (FNN) have characteristics\\nsuch as parallel computation, easy implementation, parameters convergence, and a fuzzy\\nlogic inference system, and the membership functions and the rules can be easily modelled,\\nas well as trained, using linguistic and numeric information. Nevertheless, type-1 fuzzy\\nneural network systems (Huarng 2001) face issues such as information or data uncer-\\ntainty, which can be treated with the help of type-2 fuzzy (Chakravarty and Dash 2012;\\nLee et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2012) sets, which minimize the effects of uncertainties in rule-base\\nfuzzy logic systems (Lee et al. 2003). Other fuzzy hybrids include ensembles of ANFIS\\nmodels (Melin et al. 2012), ensembles of ANFIS models with genetic optimization of inter-\\nval type-2 and type-1 fuzzy integrators (Soto et al. 2016), and ensembles of interval type-2\\nfuzzy neural network aggregation models (FAM) with modular neural networks (MNNs)\\n(Soto et al. 2019).\\n4.2.3. Training Algorithm\\nThe training phase in the model computation requires a training algorithm that helps\\nin minimizing the loss index function that measures the AI model performance on a data set.\\nThe loss index function is composed of the error term and a regularization term, where the\\nerror term evaluates the ﬁtness of the dataset in an AI model, and the regularization term\\nhelps in preventing the over-ﬁtting problem (Hsieh et al. 2011). The back-propagation (BP)\\nalgorithm is the most widely accepted training method, incorporated by approximately\\n36% of the surveyed articles (Enke and Mehdiyev 2013; Guo et al. 2015).\\nSince the BP algorithm has a chance of being stuck in local minima, it may struggle to\\nlocate the global optimal solution. So far, the existing literature has relied on evolutionary\\nalgorithms (EAs), which are thought to be the most effective at locating the global solution\\ndue to the usage of probabilistic transformation rules, rather than deterministic rules, in\\nupdating the solutions. Numerous studies have proposed multiple variants of EAs to date,'),\n",

Adam is considered computa-\\ntionally efﬁcient, requires less memory, and is unaffected by the diagonal rescaling of the\\ngradients (Kingma and Ba 2014). The boosting algorithms have the potential of enhancing\\nthe performance of the weak learning algorithm. They aid in selecting training sets for\\nthe weak classiﬁer to force it to conclude something novel regarding the data after each\\niteration.\\n4.2.4. Performance Measure\\nThe performance measures are used to evaluate the AI model performance, and are\\nclassiﬁed into statistical and non-statistical measures (see Table 6). Some of the statistical\\nmeasures used in surveyed articles are mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error\\n(MAE), mean squared prediction error (MSPE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean\\nabsolute percentage error (MAPE), normalized mean square error (NMSE), squared cor-\\nrelation (R-square), and standard deviation. Even though statistical errors provide an\\noverview, they are insufﬁcient for evaluating the model, providing no information on the\\ndirection of the stock price movement as investment decisions are taken according to the\\ngeneral trend (i.e., higher or lower next price). Therefore, the majority of the articles include\\nnon-statistical performance measures (Atsalakis et al. 2016). The non-statistical measures\\nonly deal with the proﬁtability side of the forecast, the most common being the HIT rate,\\nwhich calculates how successful the trend-forecasting abilities of the proposed model is\\n(Atsalakis et al. 2016). Other non-statistical measures include an average rate of return,\\ntrend prediction, average annual proﬁt, break-even transaction cost, and cumulative abnor-\\nmal return. It is not reported in the reviewed articles regarding the superior performance\\nmeasure for models forecast comparison, however, only a few articles provide deﬁnite\\nconclusions about which measure is the best (Atsalakis et al. 2016).'),\n",

Gaps in the Extant Literature\\nThe results of this study indicate interesting areas that lacked critical examination and\\nmuch deserved scholarly attention. Firstly, the input data being an essential part of the AI\\nmodel is not investigated or fairly selected by most authors, as they directly inﬂuence the\\ntime series estimation, and the entire model simulation and training depend on it.\\nSecondly, the prediction accuracy relies on the optimal parameter selection used\\nto implement AI models that can result in even more signiﬁcant results. The extant\\nliterature unveiled that a varied combination of input variables is employed with different\\nmodel characteristics, where every study provided satisfactory results. Since the model\\narchitecture directly impacts the system performance, many authors tried to improve the\\nmodel architecture in their study, but they were partially successful. Most of them have\\nemployed trial and error methods, which are a labor-intensive and time-consuming process,\\nwithout explaining their choices. Furthermore, many studies have estimated the degree\\nof accuracy and the acceptability of certain forecasts by computing the deviations from\\nthe observed values (Bildirici and Ersin 2014b; Hao and Gao 2020). However, forecasting\\nmethods that report minimal forecast error may not be enough to meet the objective of\\nproﬁt maximization for the ﬁnancial market practitioners, which means that stock trading\\nwith even a small forecast error may prove to be disadvantageous, calling for the need for\\naccurate forecasting of the direction of movement. Thirdly, data pre-processing being an\\nessential part of the experiment is vaguely applied in the existing literature. According\\nto Atsalakis and Valavanis (2009a), the pre-processing of input data may affect the model\\nprediction performance. Large ranged values of input data can suppress the training\\nprocess effectiveness, therefore, data transformation techniques such as data scaling can\\nhelp in providing the solution to the mentioned problem. Also, selecting appropriate\\nindicators through sensitivity analysis can assist the elimination of redundant inputs,\\nleading to better performance results.'),\n",

Validation is a\\ncritical aspect of any AI model construction, and relies on the performance measures used\\nto analyze the result, hence, it is imperative to report a superior performance measure or a\\ncombination of them. Experimental validation aims to determine how well a learned AI\\nmodel generalizes to a test set of data in place of the training set. This helps determine\\nwhether the model is overﬁtting or underﬁtting the results, such that an appropriate\\ndecision can be made (Twomey and Smith 1995). Just 50% of the papers reviewed in our\\nstudy used the validation package, whereas the remainder presented their ﬁndings directly\\nfrom the test set, omitting the critical phase of experimental validation. Additionally, there\\nis a lack of nonlinear and medium/long-term time series forecasting, as most strategies\\nconcentrate on short-term forecasting. Also, there is a lack of references to other artiﬁcial\\nintelligence techniques and multistep ahead forecasting.\\n6. Future Research Agenda\\nOver the past two decades, the extant literature on AI application to stock market\\nprediction has grown exponentially. This review suggests different areas for future research\\n(see Figure 4). First, future researchers can focus on implementing feature selection algo-\\nrithms, and propose a parameter optimization method for different neural networks to\\nobtain better experimental results. Only a few studies have employed feature selection\\nalgorithms. These ﬁndings further emphasize the importance of prospective researchers\\nvalidating the proposed techniques (Chen et al. 2013a). Second, the existing literature fo-\\ncuses on short-term ﬁnancial series forecasting, necessitating the need to investigate more\\nmid-term, long-term, and very short-term (hourly or minutely) ﬁnancial series forecasting,\\nwhich can assist intraday traders and other ﬁnancial investors in generating considerable\\nproﬁts. The literature on the intra-day stock price prediction is scarce, which could be\\npicked, by future researchers.\\nJ.\\xa0Risk\\xa0Financial\\xa0Manag.\\xa02021,\\xa014,\\xa0x\\xa0FOR\\xa0PEER\\xa0REVIEW\\xa0

Risk Financial Manag. 2021, 14, 526 19 of 34\\nMoreover, it was observed that the developed AI models function differently for developed\\nmarkets (Cheng et al. 2007; Dong and Zhou 2002) and developing markets (Dai et al. 2012;\\nZhou et al. 2019). Harvey (1995) examined that the degree of predictability in the emerging\\nor developing markets is much greater than what is seen in developed markets. Fur-\\nthermore, local information plays a signiﬁcant role in predicting returns in emerging or\\ndeveloping markets compared to developed markets. This characteristic can aid in ex-\\nplaining the predictability disparity between the two kinds of markets. Future researchers\\nshould focus on determining the cause for this discrepancy and, speciﬁcally, distinguishing\\nthe types of AI models used in both cases. Fourth, data pre-processing techniques, such as\\ndata transformation, scaling, and principal component analysis, can be used more often\\nto increase prediction precision. Numerous studies on time series analysis have shown\\nthat pre-processing raw data is beneﬁcial and essential for system reliability and model\\ngeneralization to unknown data (Guo et al. 2015). As new data is gathered for stock market\\nforecasts, if the predictive model can be reﬁned to account for it, the model’s adaptation to\\nthe new data can improve, and its predictive accuracy can increase. Atsalakis and Valavanis\\n(2009b) suggested that not all papers include pre-processing data information, or whether\\nany pre-processing methods are used. This highlights the signiﬁcance of considering the\\npre-processing techniques used in stock market forecasting. To improve the forecasting\\nmodel’s performance, more effective dimensional reduction approaches should be applied.\\nFifth, most reviewed articles concentrate on the one-step-ahead forecast (that uses an out-\\nput neuron). There are two forms of prediction: one-step-ahead and multiple-steps-ahead,\\nwhere multiple-steps ahead prediction has been considered superior due to its dynamic\\nnature (Dong et al. 2013). Future researchers may focus on multiple-step ahead predictions\\nto develop accurate, high-performing AI prediction models with a high degree of accuracy.\\nSixth, since current scholarship does not have a superior output criterion for comparing\\nmodel predictions, prospective researchers may experiment with, and compare, various\\nperformance metrics (statistical, non-statistical, or both) to determine their measuring\\npower and suitability for AI models, thus, assisting in reporting more accurate results.\\nAdditionally, prospective researchers may perform experimental validation to determine\\nif their model is over- or under-ﬁtting the results, which will assist them in improving\\nprediction accuracy.\\nSeventh, the implementation of more than one AI technique for comparison can\\nbe adopted in maximum studies focusing on stock market prediction. Moreover, most\\nstudies that have proposed a hybrid AI model have reported superior prediction accuracy\\ncompared to the single AI model, which calls for the need to experiment with hybrid AI\\ntechniques in the stock returns prediction area. Lastly, future researchers can also use\\ntextual data and quantitative data to obtain higher prediction accuracy in their prediction\\nmodel.\\n7. Conclusions\\nArtiﬁcial neural network-based models can replicate or imitate the functioning of the\\nhuman brain, and automatically determine predictions’ accuracy without the intervention\\nof the human brain (Dhenuvakonda et al. 2020). However, ANNs have limitations: there\\nare no established techniques for designing the optimal ANN model or network, and the\\nright model (with high prediction accuracy) is highly dependent on the complexity of the\\ndata and implementation (Göçken et al. 2016).\\nWe systematically reviewed 148 articles that have implemented neural networks\\nand hybrid-neuro models to forecast stock market behavior. The authors have classiﬁed\\nthe models into seven themes: stock market covered; input data; data pre-processing;\\nartiﬁcial intelligence technique; training algorithm; performance measure; and nature\\nof the study. We observe that neural and hybrid-neuro approaches are ideal for stock\\nmarket forecasting since they provide more accurate outcomes than the traditional models\\nused in the majority of studies. Nonetheless, problems emerge when determining the\\nmodel structure, which involves specifying the number of hidden layers, neurons, training'),\n",

Individual investors with no knowledge of stock market economics\\nwill also beneﬁt from ﬁnancial prediction systems: any reasonable outlook would inspire\\npopular investors to invest in stock markets, thus assisting the economy in expanding.\\nIndeed, as uncertainty has risen due to unforeseen occurrences, such as the COVID-19\\npandemic (Zhang et al. 2020), it has become more difﬁcult to forecast potential capital\\nmarket activity using conventional techniques. Thus, it is critical to investigate how the\\nimplementation of AI can boost stock market forecasting.\\nAdditionally, as market predictability improves as a result of better AI models, more\\nindividuals will begin saving, enabling businesses to collect additional funds from equity\\nmarkets to cover leverage, new product launches, industry growth, and marketing costs.\\nThis will further boost customer and company sentiment, which has a positive effect on\\nthe overall economy (Müller 2019), including the businesses of depositories, banks, mutual\\nfund organizations, insurance companies, and investment companies (Neuhierl and Weber\\n2017; Škrinjari´ c and Orlovi´ c 2020). With increased investments in the ﬁnancial markets,\\nthe tax collections shall increase, hence, beneﬁtting the government in attaining the goal of\\ninclusive and sustainable development (Neuhierl and Weber 2017).\\nFurthermore, the fractal properties of ﬁnancial markets (according to FMH) have\\nimplications for ﬁnancial stability. FMH considers non-linear relationships, in which\\nmarket prices may be inherent in the underlying (fractal) structure, dynamically adjusting\\nto changes in demand and supply with abrupt changes (sharp corrections or sudden\\nlosses). Therefore, when examining the measurement and management of market risk, risk\\nmanagers and regulators should take into account the market’s structure, including the\\ntime zones of its key investors, and the mechanism by which liquidity is formed. Moreover,\\nsudden market disruptions can compel long-term investors to exit the market abruptly,\\npotentially resulting in signiﬁcant price drops in otherwise relatively stable markets. More\\nmarket stabilizing tools must be introduced going forward in order to help bolster the\\nconﬁdence of longer-term investors and thus, market stability.\\nAuthor Contributions: G.D.S.: Conceptualization, Methodology, Supervision, Writing—Reviewing\\nand Editing; R.C.: Writing—Original draft preparation, Visualization, Data curation.
